This app is created simply in the matter of learning and my studies.
I'm trying to use React and several modules to solve such use-cases of mine:

1. I need to see a map with a list of places
2. Initially, it shows me list of caffes and restaurants all together
3. When I go to Caffee page I see only caffes on the map.
4. When I go to Caffee page there is a list of caffes in the bottom.
5. When I go to Restaurants page I see only restaurants on the map.
6. When I go to Restaurants page there is a list of restaurants in the bottom.
